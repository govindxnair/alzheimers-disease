# A Comparative Analysis and Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease
This research project was conducted as part of my postgraduate degree in M.Sc. (Applied Statistics and Data Analytics). The study performs a comparative analysis of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using a public dataset of brain MRI scans. The project evaluates and contrasts the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) against a DenseNet121 convolutional neural network.
